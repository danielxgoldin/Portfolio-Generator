Hello, as a developer myself. I thought it would be useful to create a readme.md generator to help people save time on creating this part of there development. 

Introduction-

This app was created to help you save time while back-end and front-end coding, by generating a readme.md based off of user imput to specific prompts.

Requirements-

There are no requirements for this application to function. As long as you are able to access it. It will work. 

Installation-

You will need to have VSCODE installed on your computer. You will then open the code in that terminal. Once you have the terminal open you will type index.js. 
After this you will answer the questions. After you receive a "File created" response. You will find it in the folder labled "dist." 

Maintainers-
